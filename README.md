# Outliers-and-Feature-Scaling
Dealing with Outliers, removing the outliers and/or applying multiple scaling techniques on RICE MSC dataset

A total of 75 thousand pieces of rice grain were obtained, including 15 thousand pieces of each variety of rice (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, Karacadag). A total of 106 features were inferred from the images; 12 morphological features and 4 shape features obtained using morphological features and 90 color features obtained from five different color spaces (RGB, HSV, Lab*, YCbCr, XYZ).

Outliers are those data points which differs significantly from other observations present in given dataset. It can occur because of variability in measurement and due to misinterpretation in filling data points.

There are some techniques used to deal with outliers.
